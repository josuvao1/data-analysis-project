# data-analysis-project
This project is a web-based API developed using Flask, designed to predict the tips customers are likely to leave at a restaurant. The API takes into account various factors such as the total bill, day of the week, time of day, number of diners, waiter's experience, and customer satisfaction to generate a tip prediction.
